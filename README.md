# IoT-Pitch-In

Purpose: 
This Arduino code uses various sensors and LCD, to transmit and receive data from the ttn (The Things Stack). The received data is used to control LEDs. I will also show the technique to control the angular movement of the servo. Similar principles can be applied to any Arduino board with different sensors mounted. 

Additionally, Arduino was put into sleep mode and save some power. During the project, humidity, temperature and distance were send to ttn.
