# IoT-Pitch-In

Purpose: 
This Arduino code uses various sensors and LCD, to transmit and receive data from the ttn (The Things Stack). The received data is used to control LEDs. I will also show the technique to control the angular movement of the servo. Similar principles can be applied to any Arduino board with different sensors mounted.
